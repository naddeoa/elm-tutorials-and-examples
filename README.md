Elm tutorials and examples
===

This is a repository of small tutorials and examples of the things that I've
learned in Elm. Hopefully other people find this useful over time. I'll keep
adding stuff here as I come across them. Eventually, its my secret plan to be
able to leverage these lessons while converting my coworkers and friends into
Elm enthusiasts.

I was debating between this format and a blog, but I think this is more
accessible. Wit this, I can have buildable projects next to the write up;
readmes in markdown paired with comments in source seem to be sufficient for
the documentation portion.

# Comparing API Implementations: Exposing Union Types vs Exposing Records

The `unions-instead-of-records` dir has small write up that compares the
advantages and disadvantages of designing your module to expose raw record types
vs opaque union types.
